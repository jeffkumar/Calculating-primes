# Calculating-primes

This is a fun little exercise. 

Calculating primes is slow, because there really isn't a good function for it.

In this example i'm using the Sieve of Erosthenes to calculate the primes. 

I am using a web worker in the background to show how more complex tasks can be run in the background and not block the first paint of the browser.
