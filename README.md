# Calculating-primes
 
Calculating primes is slow just like painting the dom with charts.

In this example i'm using the Sieve of Erosthenes to calculate the primes up to 20 million. 

I am using a web worker in the background to show how more complex and slow tasks like this can be run in the background and not block the first paint of the browser.
